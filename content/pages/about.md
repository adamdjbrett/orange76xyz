Welcome to Orange 76. This site is a public digital RSS reader for religious studies. I love the open web and I truly miss Google Reader. As I have been compiling all the awesome Religious Studies sites I have been struggling to 1. find a way to share them with students 2. share them with others 3. learn what I am missing. After having built [Religious Studies CFP - relcfp.com](https://relcfp.com) for public use I decided to build a public RSS feed reader for religious studies. Thankfully [@lwojcik](https://github.com/lwojcik) had the perfect template for this project.

## Costs
I'm sure you are wondering about the strange domain, well I wanted to start simple and cheap building this project to see if others are interested in it or if it is a just me project. The .XYZ domain name made famous by Alphabet (abc.xyz) has a domain class called [1.11b domains](https://gen.xyz/1111b) which are 6-9 digit domain names for $0.99 USD.

The costs of this project are:
Namecheap XYZ domain | $0.84
Github for education | free
Cloudflare DNS | free
Netlify hosting | free

## Made with
* [Eleventy SSG](https://11ty.dev)
* This site is based on [M10y an Eleventy-based RSS aggregator template](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-m10y).
